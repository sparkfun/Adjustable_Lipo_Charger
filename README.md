[*Adjustable LiPo Charger (PRT-14380)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14380)

The Adjustable LiPo Charger will charge any single cell Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) or Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery with a maximum current of 500mA. Simply plug in a micro B USB cable or any power supply between 3.75-6VDC to one end, and your rechargeable lithium battery to the other end. Once the current has been set on the DIP switches you're ready to go to charge your battery in 100mA increments up to 500mA, or as low as 15mA using the custom charge rate by soldering in the appropriate resistor to R_PTH.
